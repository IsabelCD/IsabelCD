<h1>Hi, my name is Isabel!</h1>
I am a Data Science student currently working at my university (Nova IMS) on a project to incorporate new statistical and machine learning techniques into the current auditing framework in Portugal. Throughout my journey, I had the opportunity to use several different tools for analysing and extracting useful information from data. To better understand each concept and how they might be useful in real-life scenarios, I applied the theoretical knowledge I acquired to different projects. Here's a glimpse of what I bring to the table, and projects that show my capabilities:


<h2>üåü Technical Skills:</h2>

- <b>Languages</b>: Proficient in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn), R, SQL.
